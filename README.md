# Unitary_quantum_perceptron

This project realizes a unitary quantum perceptron with quantum computing. Interestingly, the quantum perceptron can be implemented as a single (fast) adiabatic passage in a model of interacting spins.

It is inspired by the recent work: Unitary quantum perceptron as efficient universal approximator.

All code is written in Python. Libraries required with the versions used: pennylane 0.18.0.
